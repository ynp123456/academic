            <h3>The problem of path decomposition for graphs with treewidth at most 4</h3>
            <p>April 2020 - November 2020<br>
            Advisor: Prof. Changhong Lu, School of Mathematical Sciences and Shanghai Key Laboratory of PMMP, ECNU<br>
            The renowned Gallai Conjecture posits that a connected simple graph with n vertices can be decomposed using at most $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ paths. As one of the core conjectures in graph theory, eminent scholars like Lovász have made outstanding contributions in this field. In 2019, Botler proved the conjecture to be true for graphs with treewidth at most 3. My master’s thesis expanded on Botler’s findings, demonstrating that the conjecture also holds true for graphs with treewidth at most 4. (1st Revise & Resubmit, Discrete Mathematics)</p>

            <h3>The problem of Turán numbers of two disjoint stars</h3>
            <p>March 2020 - April 2020<br>
            Extremal Graph Theory, a popular field within Graph Theory, primarily investigates the maximum number of edges a graph can possess without containing a certain subgraph. In this paper, we consider the problem of the Turán number for two disjoint stars, which broadened previous results.</p>
